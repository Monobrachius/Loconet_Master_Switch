# Loconet_Master_Switch

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE software: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software  
2. Install relevant libraries: Top bar: Tools -> Manage libraries -> 
  - search for "Loconet" and install latest version  
  - search for "Bounce2" and install latest version  
3. Download the .ino file from https://github.com/Monobrachius/Loconet_Master_Switch which contains the code for the emergency stop button.  
   At this moment I cannot find the download button, so you have to manually copy the code from: https://github.com/Monobrachius/Loconet_Master_Switch/blob/main/Loconet_Master_Switch_HK_V02.ino  
4. Select the desired options in the software
  -//Definitions  
   const int  EStopLatching              = 0;    //1 = latching (button does not fall back, but needs turning/pushing to return to "normal" position), 0 = momentary
   const int  EStopNCtype                = 0;    //1 = NC, 0 = NO
   const int  EStopOneButtonForAll       = 0;    //1 = one momentary button for set and reset, 0 for two buttons or a latching button
   const int  EStopKeptActiveWhilePushed = 0;    //1 = Keeping E-Stop while pushed, 0 = E-Stop can be reset while button is still pushed, but button will flash in that case.
   
5. Select the correct Arduino: Top bar: Tools -> Board -> select desired board.  
  - The board is tested with the following theArduino Nano & Arduino Pro Mini. Other boards might work as well, but are not tested. 
6. Select the correct processor: Top bar: Tools -> Processor -> select used processor  
  - Arduino Nano: red board is the Atmega168 (should also be mentioned when you buy it), the blue ones with USB-C are most times Atmega328P, the blue ones with Mini-USB are most times Atmega328P with old bootloader.  
  - Arduino Pro Mini: check with your supplier, there is a too wide of range to simply link it by color and port type.  

7. Press compile (left check mark âœ“, just below "File" ont the Top bar), this will check if the code compiles, or that something is incorrect (most times: library missing, or wrong type of board)  
8. If you have chosen the correct board, processor and port (port should autoselect when you plug in only 1 Arduino), it should compile the code once again and after that straight away upload to the Arduino.
